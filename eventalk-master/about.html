                    <p class="mb-4">IUCEE is the definition of "experiential learning with purpose". I had always wondered to myself as an engineering student "Why are we as engineers so important?" The answer to this question I found in the Kletech IUCEE chapter when I learned being in an environment that stimulates minds to think along the lines of solving real-life problems with technology and this in return helped me bringing engineering solutions to solve society's problems. Because "who are we as engineers if we do not help the society?". It is exhilarating when you find the right answers to questions that are important to you, I can assure you that the question above was important to me as something along the same lines was asked to me in my HR interview for placement. Knowing that no question is unimportant and every answer has a purpose my journey at IUCEE has been enriching</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">In the early days of my college life during the first year of my B. Tech program, In a situation where I need to speak about sustainability in India spontaneously. At that time I didn't even have a basic idea of how sustainability takes place in India. That situation sparked my curiosity and encouraged me to seek in-depth knowledge about sustainability. After attending 8 weeks of Sustainability inquiry workshop, I attended IASF-2023 at VVCE College, Mysore. IASF-2023 took place from January 2nd to 6th. It gathered students from various IUCEE Chapters across different states, facilitating the exchange of ideas and thought processes related to various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As a member of the SDG-11 team within IASF, I participated in conducting research on environmental issues aligned with our sustainability development goal with our team. Together, we identified and formulated a clear problem statement, and with the guidance of our mentor, Berjis Driver Sir, we proposed effective solutions. It was a valuable opportunity to collaborate with such experienced experts. IASF-2023 has brought about a significant change in our lives, I now conscientiously consider the environmental impact of my actions, whether it's minimizing food wastage or responsibly disposing of waste, which has become my newfound habit. Apart from my personal development, what I learned from IASF-2023 from a professional perspective are problem-solving skills, networking, and adaptation to changing times. I wholeheartedly look forward to engaging in more enriching events like IASF in the future.</p>

The guidance provided by UN mentors proved invaluable, allowing me to engage with like-minded individuals who shared a desire to contribute to society. We had the opportunity to view our project from various perspectives, thanks to the valuable suggestions offered by several industry delegates who observed our project display. All in all, the event was truly unforgettable, and I gained numerous insights and key takeaways from it.</p>

Over those three days, I had the privilege of engaging in a multitude of technical and informative sessions, expanding my knowledge base and igniting my passion for engineering and innovation. The event's highlights included an inspiring walkathon through Mysore's picturesque streets, where I forged unforgettable memories and had the honor of learning from mentors like Krishna Sir and Sampada Pachaury Mam, who fueled my ambitions. The pinnacle was presenting my AI-based water disinfection project to an audience of scholars and influential figures, including the motivational Mr. Nile, an American professor. This event underscored the vital role engineers play in preserving our environment, instilling in me a profound sense of responsibility to develop sustainable solutions for a brighter future. In conclusion, the IUCEE and IASF event at Vidyavardhaka College in Mysore was a transformative experience, expanding my technical expertise and inspiring me to commit to sustainability and innovation in my engineering journey.</p>

This 3 -day conference helped us think sustainably and contribute judiciously towards the betterment of mother earth. All the mentors guided us on how to tackle the problems, how to narrow down and navigate the solutions to the existing problems and how effectively we can build a sustainable awareness model. And also the 5-km walkathon around the city of Mysore was a wakening call for all of us to get reminded as a responsible greener citizen. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to IUCEE organizations, Ms. Sampada Pachaury mam and all our mentors for their untiring and unwavering support to get the best out from us!! Their words of action and speech was motivating and gave a conscious bell to the conscience to build an eco-greener environment and abide to the same....!.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">IASF 2023 was an eye-opening experience that I will forever cherish. My journey from Hyderabad to Mysuru began with little to no prior knowledge about IUCEE and its mission. However, from the moment I stepped into the IUCEE Annual Student Forum, I was immersed in a world of innovation, education, and sustainable development. The highlight of my IASF experience was the opportunity to work alongside UN Ambassadors on SDG 15 - Life on Land. This collaboration exposed me to the pressing global challenges related to environmental conservation, deforestation, and ecosystem preservation. It was incredible to witness the dedication and passion of the UN Ambassadors in their mission to make the world a better place. The learnings and exposure I gained at IASF were truly transformative. I was inspired by the diverse group of students who shared their unique perspectives and innovative ideas. This motivated me to bring a similar platform to my university, Anurag University. Hence, the concept of AUNSF (Anurag University National Student Forum) was born. IASF served as a catalyst for me and my peers to replicate the spirit of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and commitment to sustainable development within our own university. In conclusion, IASF 2023 was not just an event but a life-changing experience that broadened my horizons, connected me with remarkable individuals, and empowered me to make a positive impact in the world. I am grateful to IUCEE for this opportunity and look forward to contributing to the global mission of education and sustainable development.
